String Reversal: (optional for time begin....)

Create a function named reverseString that takes a string as input and returns its reversed version.
Display the reversed version of myString using the reverseString function.
String Splitting and Joining:

Declare a variable named sentence and assign it a string containing multiple words.
Use the split method to convert the sentence into an array of words.
Use the join method to join the array of words back into a string with hyphens ("-") between each word.
Display the resulting string.
String Searching and Counting:

Declare a variable named longText and assign it a long string that includes repeated occurrences of a specific word.
Use the indexOf method to find the first occurrence of the word.
Use a loop and indexOf to count and display the total number of occurrences of the word in the longText.
String Regular Expression:

Declare a variable named email and assign it an email address (e.g., "user@example.com").
Use a regular expression and the test method to check if the email address is valid.
Display a message indicating whether the email address is valid or not.
String Character Iteration:

Create a function named countVowels that takes a string as input and returns the count of vowels (both uppercase and lowercase) in the string.
Display the count of vowels in myString using the countVowels function.
String Formatting:

Declare variables for a person's first name, last name, and age.
Use string template literals to create a sentence introducing the person, incorporating their name and age.
Display the formatted sentence.
String Padding:

Declare a variable named numberString and assign it a number converted to a string (e.g., "42").
Use the padStart method to add leading zeros to make the string at least 5 characters long.
Display the padded string.
String Comparison:

Declare two strings that represent version numbers (e.g., "1.2.3" and "1.2.10").
Write a function named compareVersions that compares these version strings and displays which one is greater.
Use the localeCompare method for version comparison.
